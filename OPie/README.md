# OPie TBC
OPie TBC is a clone of the AddOn made by foxlit to support WoW Classic TBC (v. 2.5.4.44171). OPie adds configurable radial action bars revealed with any chosen binding that perform actions based on where your mouse cursor is.

OPie is ideal for hiding actions that are frequently used yet aren't required to be shown at all times. OPie rings can contain your abilities, items, professions, battle pets, equipment sets, macros, and raid or world markers. Some rings for common class abilities and professions are included, as is a special quest items ring which automatically makes all of your quest and quest-starting items easily accessible. Other addons may add additional rings; for example, Spade uses OPie rings to let you chose the seeds you want to plant on your farm.
